  <h1>My First Blog Post</h1>
  <p>This is the content of my very first blog post, located in a subdirectory!</p>
  <p>The static site generator successfully processed this file from the nested 'blog' folder.</p>
  <p>Asset paths like <a href="/about.html">this link</a> or the CSS/JS links in the header/footer should still work because they use root-relative paths (starting with '/').</p>
